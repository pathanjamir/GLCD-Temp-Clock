**8051 Microcontroller-based Real-Time Clock with DS1307 RTC, LM35 Temperature Sensor, MCP3204 ADC, and GLCD Display**

This project is a real-time clock system based on the 8051 microcontroller. It utilizes the DS1307 Real-Time Clock (RTC) module, LM35 temperature sensor, MCP3204 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), and a Graphical LCD (GLCD) display. The system is capable of displaying time, date, and temperature information.

**Project Overview**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a real-time clock system using 8051 microcontroller architecture. It provides an example of interfacing various peripheral components, including the DS1307 RTC module, LM35 temperature sensor, MCP3204 ADC, and GLCD display. The system displays the current time, date, and temperature on the GLCD.

**Features**
Real-time clock functionality with accurate timekeeping using the DS1307 RTC module.
Temperature sensing using the LM35 sensor to monitor ambient temperature.
Analog-to-digital conversion of LM35 output using the MCP3204 ADC.
Display of time, date, and temperature on a GLCD.
